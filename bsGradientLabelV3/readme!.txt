Hey, glad you at least downloaded this.
This is the third installment of the bsGradientLabel control, started earlier this year by myself. I'm trying to get it out of the way to concentrate on university work and my first ever game.

New features include:
   + Multiline text - yes, both horizontal and vertical.
   + Non-TrueType font warning (with a vertical label), which can be turned off.

To run the demo, first rename bsGradientLabel.bin to bsGradientLabel.ocx and then Demo.bin to Demo.exe. This will save yourself a headache later on.

As always, if you like this ActiveX control, you can help me win Code of the Month! To vote for this control, or any other control, just do a search for its name in Planet Source Code.

If you find any bugs, have any suggestions or just want to air your £0.02, you can leave feedback or e-mail me.

If you use this in any of your programs or create a deriative ActiveX control, please give me credit where it's due. Let me know where you use it!
