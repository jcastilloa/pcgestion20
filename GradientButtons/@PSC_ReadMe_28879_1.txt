Title: [A Command Button with gradient filter (ActiveX Control)] UPDATED!
Description: Updated! Very nice command button (ActiveX control) with gradient filling. If client screen color depth is 256 colors or less – looks as regular command button. You can change caption-image order (position) from left to right or top to bottom.
When created this control - used two algorithms from www.planet-source-code.com. 
Want to say personal thank you to: 
Rocky Clark (Gradient filter algorithm); 
Manuel Augusto Santos (Emboss filter algorithm). 
Please rate it!

Feel free to use this control in your application (if you'd like to) as much as you want. If you'll modify it - please leave my name in the About box! Enjoy! PS: (Please rate it)
